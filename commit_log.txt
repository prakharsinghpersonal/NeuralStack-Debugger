- Commit 2 (Profiling Engine): Implement the low-level C++ tracing mechanism that logs execution times and memory allocations of massively-parallel inference steps.
- Commit 3 (Bottleneck Detection): Write the analysis logic to parse the traces and identify deeply hidden runtime bottlenecks (e.g., kernel launch overhead, memory stalls).
- Commit 4 (Python Interface): Create a Python wrapper that developers can use to wrap their PyTorch/TensorFlow code and generate the C++ profiling reports.
